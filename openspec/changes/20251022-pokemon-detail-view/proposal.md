# OpenSpec Proposal: Pokemon Detail View 宝可梦详细信息查看

## Problem Statement

The game currently lacks a comprehensive Pokemon viewing interface. Players cannot view detailed information about their team members, including:
- Individual stats and base stats comparison
- IVs (Individual Values) and Nature modifiers
- Talents/Abilities
- Moves and experience details
- Capture information

## Solution Overview

Implement a complete Pokemon detail viewing system that displays:

1. **Team List View** - Display all 6 Pokemon in the player's team with quick stats
2. **Pokemon Detail View** - Comprehensive information page for selected Pokemon including:
   - Basic info (name, species, level, experience)
   - Base stats (species racial values)
   - Actual stats (with IV and Nature adjustments)
   - Individual Values (IV breakdown)
   - Nature and stat modifiers
   - Talent/Ability
   - Moves and PP
   - Capture info (location, method, date)

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Players can understand their team composition and Pokemon capabilities
- **Gameplay**: Enables informed decisions about team building and training
- **Completeness**: Makes the game feel like a real Pokemon experience

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team list menu displays all 6 Pokemon with status
- [ ] Pokemon selection opens detailed view
- [ ] All stat information displays correctly (base, actual, IV)
- [ ] Nature and ability information visible
- [ ] Navigate between team members in detail view
- [ ] Return to team list from detail view
- [ ] All tests pass

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW**
- Pure UI feature, no game logic changes
- No impact on existing systems
- Builds on existing data structures (PokemonInstance, PokemonStats)
